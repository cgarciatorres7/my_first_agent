# My First Agent

A project exploring and implementing agentic AI systems. This repository serves as a playground for understanding and building autonomous AI agents that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate and experiment with agentic AI systems - AI that can act autonomously to achieve specific goals. The repository includes implementations of various agent architectures, decision-making processes, and interaction patterns.

## Features

- 🤖 Autonomous agent implementation
- 🧠 Decision-making systems
- 🔄 Environment interaction capabilities
- 📊 Performance monitoring and evaluation
- 🛠️ Extensible architecture for different agent types

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_first_agent.git
cd my_first_agent
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
